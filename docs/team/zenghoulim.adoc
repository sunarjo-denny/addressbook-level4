=== Enhancement Added: `remark` Command
==== External behavior

---

Adds a `remark` to a person in the address book
Format: `remark INDEX [r/REMARK]`


#Start of Extract [from: UserGuide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=remark]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

While a `remark` field is similar in nature to `tag` field, they serve different purpose. The former is used to store short phrase about a person (e.g. Likes to drink coffee and has good sense of humor) whereas the latter is suited for classifying persons in the address book.

=== Enhancement Added: `search` Command
==== External behavior

---

Similar to the `find` command.
This comand searches for persons whose details contain the given keyphrase
Format: `search [keyphrase]`


#Start of Extract [from: UserGuide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=search]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

`Search` is similar to `find`, but is more extensive. Instead of looking only at the name of the person in the addressbook, every other detail is checked. This might be useful when users are trying to search for persons who live in a particular location (e.g. search Clementi Road), or for persons who have gmail accounts (e.g. search @gmail.com). From a user experience perspective, there is high degree of consistency between this search command and the search command users would expect of web browsers, word processors and the likes.

=== Enhancement Added: `login` Command
==== External behavior

---

Authenticates the current user before giving read or write access.
Format: `login [usr/username] [pwd/password]`


#Start of Extract [from: UserGuide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=login]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Since this address book stores personal information about people, there should be some degree of security and privacy protection when it comes to using this address book. Therefore, without logging in, a user may not see or modify the contents of the address book.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Profile picture for contact
==== External behavior

---

Contacts in the address book will now be assigned to their profile pictures used on Facebook, if any. Otherwise, a default image would be used. The contact's Facebook id has to be saved before the retrieval is possible.

---

==== Justification

As this address book is meant for University students to store their contacts, it is expected to store a significant number of contacts. As such, it might be difficult to visually recognize and identify contacts solely by the words and their contact information. Moreover, this visual search may be demanding especially when contacts share the same first names. Therefore, by having a contact image, the user would be able to quickly identify their target contact.
